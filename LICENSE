world.py is taken from TurtlePower which is licenced under the MIT licence. The eventual intention is to licence Turtle Attack under the same licence.

The current GIF images are taken from Battle for Wesnoth: http://www.wesnoth.org/ which is licenced under the GPL licence: http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/wesnoth/trunk/COPYING

The intention is to replace the GIF images with original artwork in the native Turtle polygon format:
http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html#turtle.register_shape

Until these images are replaced, the combined work of images and code must be licenced under the GPL version 2.

Replacing the GIFs with polygons will also have other benefits since the polygons can then rotate and show their heading.

Artwork submissions (i.e. the list of co-ordinates) along these lines will be very welcome.
